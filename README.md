This project is coded entirely using Visual Basic. I started it when I was teaching myself VB and so I didn't heavily make use of Objects, which is something I'm willing to fix in the future.

# Purpose of this software

Kodi is a great video/audio management software; it shows series and movies in a beautiful layout with artwork and videos sorted by season. However, the software requires a strict naming of the videos in order to recognize them. Therefore, the user has to change each file individually to meet the requirements.

The idea behind this project is to automize the process through choosing the initial & final values and inserting the files in a sorted list.

# Features implemented so far

- Change the name of one file
- Change the name of multiple files
- Choose initial & final values and select a format

# Features to be implemented

- Allow the user to manage and sort the list however they want:
      The idea is to show two lists: one with the names of the selected files, and another which they have to fill with the sorted files
